# Todo:
- ~~Filepath and command processing~~ DONE
- ~~Interpreter~~ DONE
- ~~Brainfuck to C++ transpiler~~ DONE
- ~~Logo~~ DONE
- ~~Actually committing the changes~~ DONE
- `-!` (ignores incorrect loops)
- Taking arguments from the command line
- No recursion!

# Ideas for the future:
- Using getopt instead of a regex search to parse the flags
- Transpiling to more languages (x86 Assembly, Python, JavaScript, Java, WebAssembly)
- Code cleanup/improvements/rewrites as I get better with C++
- Changeable amount of memory cells
  
Feel free to give me your ideas by opening issues!
